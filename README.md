# Proximal decoding (tensor version) for LDPC-coded AWGN channel and Massive MIMO channel

This code implements a tensor version proximal decoding for LDPC-coded AWGN channel and Massive MIMO channel using PyTorch. The algorithm's details can be found in the paper titled "Proximal Decoding for LDPC Codes" by Tadashi Wadayama and Satoshi Takabe, published in *IEICE Transactions on Fundamentals of Electronics, Communications and Computer Sciences*, volume 106, issue 3 (2023), pages 359-367.
